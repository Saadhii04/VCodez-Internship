I'm happy to share that I successfully completed my Machine Learning Internship at VCodez (March – June 2025), where I gained valuable exposure to real-time AI/ML applications and enhanced my problem-solving and analytical skills.

During this internship, I worked on a project titled "LawMate: Legal Document Analyzer for Simplified Summaries", aimed at simplifying complex legal documents using transformer-based NLP models (T5).

Key Highlights:
  Fine-tuned pre-trained transformer models for summarization tasks
  Focused on processing and abstracting legal language
  Implemented text preprocessing, cleaning, and tokenization for optimal results
  Developed an interactive Streamlit-based user interface for real-time testing and summarization

Although not deployed end-to-end, the system enabled local testing and demonstrated the complete summarization workflow—from raw legal text to concise, easy-to-read summaries.

Grateful to the VCodez team for their mentorship and to my amazing teammates Ghuha Charan SLS and Mithun Bharathi for their collaboration on this project.
